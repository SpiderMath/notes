I am *Shankha Suvra Dam*, a third-year doing B.Math (hons) at [Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore](https://www.isibang.ac.in/).  

I have a variety of interests 👀, however since you're here looking at my notes pages, I'm going to assume you're gonna be more interested in my academic interests 😁.  

So, let's begin. I have a keen interest in *mathematics* (obviously), with no specific subtopics being my primary focus. However, as of now, I am really enjoying studying the following topics:

- **Dynamical Systems** as its uses throughout the real world seem really interesting
- **Game theory** as overall it seems like a really practical field of mathematics and also it is really fun to solve game theoretic problems (in my limited probing around)
- **Combinatorial algorithms** as its been introducing new ways and approaches to solve problems I never thought of and in ways I never considered! 

Apart from mathematics though, I'm also really interested in *computer science*, *linguistics* and *biology*, and approaching them from a mathematical perspective, which often leads to finding some really cool and interesting things!

Please do note that, I am still in an exploring phase, and I seem to be finding a lot of things interesting (a bit too many to be honest 🙃)
