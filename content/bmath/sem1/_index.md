## Thoughts

My first semester of college was filled with new interactions and experiences. I came across a plethora of new topics, and being completely new to pure mathematics, I was amazed. I got to know some very amazing people in our double seniors, and learnt a lot of new life skills while staying away from home for the first time (ended up missing a few classes because of no holidays during Durga Puja ðŸ˜”).  

As for academics, this was my first introduction to every single course here (except for FCP), as I had only studied the basic school curriculum till now. In fact initially, I didn't know what half of the courses even were about ðŸ˜‚. The professors however, were **extremely** helpful and started from the very basics. I mostly kept up with everything taught, *although I did end up getting an optional backpaper in Real Analysis, but I cleared that*.
